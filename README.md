# Video streaming with imagezmq
first of all i would like to thank Jeff Bass for putting together [imagezmq](https://github.com/jeffbass/imagezmq)

## Description
this two scripts use the imagezmq library to stream videos (no sound) between two hosts.
To test this out on your machine you need two cameras. And make sure to set the camera 
source in the code correctly.
If you are going to test on a network just change the ip addresses and it will work. 
Although  it might have latency issues.
